# Mapping the global distribution of lead and its isotopes in seawater with explainable machine learning

This GitHub repository contains the code developed for the article "Mapping the global distribution of lead and its isotopes in seawater with explainable machine learning" by Arianna Olivelli et al. (In review), as part of my PhD research at Imperial College London. 

The work has been funded by the Natural Environment Research Council () through the Science and Solutions for a Changing Planet Doctoral Training Programme at the Grantham Institute - Climate Change and the Environment, Imperial College London.
